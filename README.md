# Daily-Schedule-Calender


Description:

This repository contains a daily workday calender built using HTML, CSS, javascript, and JQUERY. The Calender allows you to save things hourly and the blocks change colors based on whether they are in the past, present or future. Entries are stored in local storage so they will persist throughout the day.
